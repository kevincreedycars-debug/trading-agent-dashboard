# USD session volatility regime - fx.usd-session-volatility-regime - stage 3 of 3: Adjudication

## Assignment

- Chain: `usd-factor-fx-usd-session-volatility-regime` on USD (US Dollar); chain kind `factor`.
- Factor: `fx.usd-session-volatility-regime` - USD session volatility regime.
- Group label: `usd-topic-fx-session-structure` (Session structure, overnight range and safe-haven demand). The label groups chains; it owns no stage and this prompt is the only stage you run for it.
- Stage: 3 of 3, adjudication. This stage returns exactly one Markdown document (synthesis), named `usd-fx-usd-session-volatility-regime-s3-adjudication.md`.
- Prompt template: `research-prompt-v3.1.0`, written 2026-10-13. The template is versioned: if a newer `research-prompt` template exists, that one governs and this file is superseded.
- This prompt is self-contained. Paste it as one message into a fresh session; nothing is sent to a model from the dashboard and no credential is attached to it.
- Asset status: active. The session is defined below and the data reachable from this repository is named with each input.
- Programme record: this chain has not been dispatched. Nothing has been returned for it, and this prompt is its first assignment.

## Objective

Decide one chain: settle every material objection against the stage 1 report and the stage 2 review for USD session volatility regime - fx.usd-session-volatility-regime, and return the corrected, best-supported conclusion. State what the chain rules out, what stays unresolved and what would settle it, and state a treatment of the entries only where the evidence supports one, naming every parameter that has not been measured. This stage decides on the evidence available when it is run; it does not fit, score, deploy or change a live call.

## The session and the instrument

- Session: 05:00 Europe/London to 05:00 Europe/London on the next local date. Both ends are London wall-clock times one local date apart, so every eligible session is exactly 24 hours. The contract is `docs/research/usd-session/v1/session_contract_v1.json`.
- Label instrument: DXY, and UNVERIFIED. No intraday dollar-index print exists in this repository or in the live collector, and no quote source is committed. If a claim is really about EUR/USD, a basket, the broad trade-weighted index or a futures contract, name that instrument in the same sentence and say what its window is.
- The deployed engine is not this window: it cuts off at 09:30 America/New_York and ends at the next 16:00 ET close, a median 30.5 elapsed hours. It overlaps this session for about 14.5 nominal hours and leaves the session's first 9.5 hours unmeasured. Say which window every number belongs to.
- The window is closed to later information: a value published after 05:00 London, or a revision published later, may not be used as what was known at the cutoff.

## Inputs

### The factor entries this chain answers for

These are the catalogue entries this chain is evidence for. They are context to audit, never evidence for a claim, and never the scope limit of the assignment.

- `fx.usd-session-volatility-regime` - USD session volatility regime. Role: abstention gate. Group: research_session_v1. Research status: ready.
  - What the entry stands for: Realised volatility of the label instrument and the effect of that regime on the expected move and on whether a call should be withheld.
  - Rule in force today, the baseline to audit and never evidence: No rule is in force. This is a hypothesis to be researched, not a deployed rule..
  - Series the collector reads: Price and risk package USD-SESSION-A1.
  - Published brief: `docs/research/handoff/usd/v1/packs/fx-usd-session-volatility-regime.md` (sha256 `7dfbdad10c7123852faa60d1782c458039aa5d34cff219c9d068d17fd1e268fc`, 13667 bytes). Read it with this prompt if it is attached; the questions below stand without it.

### Documents you are given

Supplied by the operator. Record the file name and the first heading of each document you judge in the header lines your deliverable asks for. If either is clearly another topic or another stage, stop and say so.

- `usd-fx-usd-session-volatility-regime-s1-research.md` - the stage 1 report for this chain, at the version and hash registered against its stage 1. As supplied: version `unknown`, sha256 `unknown`.
- `usd-fx-usd-session-volatility-regime-s2-red-team.md` - the stage 2 review for this chain, at the version and hash registered against its stage 2. As supplied: version `unknown`, sha256 `unknown`.

### Documents in this checkout

Each line names a file, the part of it that matters, its hash and what it is for. If a file is not attached to this message, answer from this prompt and say which files you could not open.

- `docs/research/usd-session/v1/session_contract_v1.json` - the session contract the cutoff and endpoint come from. sha256 `aa7c6c191e6407935b6335e941a1a66de8979f828a23e22a1f6d249b086a2757`.

## How to decide

Answer every question below, in order. Where the evidence does not exist, write that and what would settle it: an honest "not answerable from the sources I can reach" is a complete answer, a guess is not.

Resolve each material objection on the evidence; do not split the difference, do not average the two documents, and do not treat agreement between them as evidence. Where the evidence does not decide, say which finding is unresolved and what would decide it.

### Questions to decide, finding by finding

1. For each material objection: do the two documents and the sources you fetch decide it, or does it stay open?
2. Where the report and the review agree, do they rest on the same source - and if so, is that agreement evidence, or one source counted twice?
3. Which conclusion survives in corrected form, and exactly what changed in it?
4. Which objection is rejected, and what is wrong with it?
5. Which claim stays unresolved, and what measurement would settle it?
6. Is any proposed treatment computable from the data named in this prompt, and which of its parameters have not been measured?
7. Does the proposed treatment count one input twice across entries or chains, and if so, which chain owns it?
8. What must the asset synthesis decide that this chain cannot?

### Questions this chain must settle

9. Is realised volatility measured from the label instrument, from a proxy, or from an implied measure, and over which window is it observable at the cutoff? Settle it: accepted, rejected or unresolved, and what evidence decides it?
10. Does the regime change the expected direction, the expected dispersion, or only whether a call should be made at all? Settle it: accepted, rejected or unresolved, and what evidence decides it?
11. Is the abstention value of a volatility regime separable from a data-quality gate, and what threshold would be a measured quantity rather than a convention? Settle it: accepted, rejected or unresolved, and what evidence decides it?
12. Does the volatility regime interact with the VIX level and the risk state, or does it restate them in dollar terms? Settle it: accepted, rejected or unresolved, and what evidence decides it?
13. Which instrument labels these factors, given that DXY has no verified intraday source? Settle it: accepted, rejected or unresolved, and what evidence decides it?

## Evidence standard

- Name the source for every load-bearing claim: publication, series id, table or section, and the date you read it. A claim with no source is written as your reading, not as a finding.
- Cite the passage you rely on. Where a source only partly supports a claim, write what it does support and what it leaves out.
- Separate measurement from mechanism. A channel is a hypothesis; say which part of a claim has been measured and which part has not.
- State the sample behind any relation: instrument, window, era and the number of non-overlapping observations. A number with no sample is not evidence.
- Prefer the primary source to a summary, and the series documentation to a post about the series.
- Report what you could not reach: paywalls, undated pages, dead links, series with no documented vintage. Do not fill the gap with a plausible number.
- Where two sources disagree, say so and say which you would trust and why.
- Every claim about timing is about this session and this cutoff, not about a general close-to-close convention.

## Five kinds of evidence that must not be mixed

Each kind answers a different question, and evidence of one kind never stands in for another. State which kind every load-bearing claim rests on, in the sentence that makes the claim:

- **Economic mechanism** - why an input could move the dollar inside the session at all. A mechanism is a reason to look; it is not a measurement, and a plausible channel is not evidence that the channel operates.
- **Contemporaneous association** - what moves with the dollar at the same time. It says nothing about direction after the cutoff, and the dollar may be the thing doing the moving.
- **Predictive evidence from other windows** - measured relations for a close-to-close day, a New York session, an event window or a monthly horizon. Relevant background, not evidence for this session; name the window every time the number is quoted.
- **Evidence for our exact session** - a measurement of the 05:00 Europe/London start to the 05:00 Europe/London endpoint on the next local date. Where none exists for a claim, say so rather than borrowing another window's result.
- **Incremental value beyond existing inputs** - what this factor adds to a decision already able to use the entries before it. Information already contained in an earlier input is not new, and a factor that adds nothing is a finding, not a gap.

A claim that changes kind between sections - a mechanism presented as a measurement, another window presented as ours, an input already in the decision presented as new - is the most common way a body of research overstates what is known. Where the same evidence is counted twice, say so.

## Conclusions this stage is allowed to reach

- **Exclusion** - the evidence may support leaving this factor out of the decision entirely.
- **Regime-only use** - the evidence may support using it only in a named regime, and only where that regime is identifiable at the cutoff.
- **Insufficient evidence** - where nothing has been measured for this session, saying so is the correct return; the remedy is a measurement or a supplement, never a stronger claim.
- **Adding nothing** - a factor whose information is already in the inputs before it earns no weight. More factors are not assumed to improve accuracy, and improved accuracy is only ever an empirical result.
- **A potentially useful input or interaction** - the evidence may support a directional input, or a pair whose interaction carries information, as worth testing further. State the sign, the condition, the window it was evidenced on and the measurement that would validate it, and mark it unvalidated: this stage can support a candidate, never a confirmation.

## If this stage concludes that the call should be withheld

Coverage, the accuracy of the calls made, the score of the withheld calls, and a coverage-matched comparison on comparable sessions are reported together; higher accuracy reached by skipping sessions is not an improvement unless it beats that comparison on the sessions it skipped.

- Name the sessions you treat as comparable, by the regime, the calendar state and the instrument that define them. A comparison against unlike sessions is not a comparison.
- A rule that cannot be scored because the label instrument is unresolved says so, and is returned as insufficient evidence rather than as a finding.
- A threshold set by convention is named as a convention, and the cost of it is reported in the same four numbers as any other rule.

## What the adjudication must contain

The file must contain exactly these sections, in this order, each as a `## ` heading with the exact title:

  1. `## Summary - the decision, in at most ten lines`
  2. `## The documents judged - file names, first headings, versions and hashes`
  3. `## Decision register - one row per material objection: accepted, rejected or unresolved, with the evidence and the reason`
  4. `## The conclusion for this chain, in corrected form`
  5. `## What the evidence supports, by entry, with the sample behind each claim`
  6. `## What this chain rules out`
  7. `## Unresolved items, and the measurement that would settle each`
  8. `## Proposed treatment, if the evidence supports one, with every unvalidated parameter named`
  9. `## Required empirical tests and remaining blockers`
  10. `## Ownership of inputs that overlap another chain`
  11. `## Handoff to central USD synthesis`
  12. `## Sources`

Keep a section that turns out to be empty, and say in one sentence why it is empty.
Do not restate these instructions, and do not add a section that summarises the prompt.

## What to return

Return exactly one Markdown file and nothing else.

- File name: `usd-fx-usd-session-volatility-regime-s3-adjudication.md`. Copy it exactly: the library records the name it receives and matches it to the prompt that asked for it.
- Format: one Markdown file. No JSON, no zip, no PDF, no spreadsheet, no second file, no separate sources note, no filled-in card.
- Length: as long as the material needs, and no longer. A short file that answers every question beats a long one that answers some.
- Header lines, above the first heading, in this form:

```
Reviewed chain: usd-factor-fx-usd-session-volatility-regime
Reviewed document: <the file name you were given>
Reviewed version: <the version you were given, or unknown>
Reviewed sha256: <the hash you were given, or unknown>
Reviewed first heading: <the first heading of that document, verbatim>
```

Write `unknown` where a version or a hash was not supplied. Do not invent one, and do not stop because it is missing.

## Completion checklist

Walk this list before you return the file. A "no" means the file is not ready.

- [ ] Every material objection from the review has a decision.
- [ ] Every decision names the evidence it rests on.
- [ ] Agreement between the two documents that rests on one source is identified as such.
- [ ] The corrected conclusion can be used without reading either input document.
- [ ] Every unresolved item carries the measurement that would settle it.
- [ ] Any treatment names its unmeasured parameters and the chain that owns each overlapping input.
- [ ] Nothing here changes a live call, and no parameter is presented as validated.

## Prohibitions

- Do not treat a rule in force as evidence for itself. It is the baseline you are auditing.
- Do not propose or make a change to a live engine, a live call or a deployed workflow.
- Do not invent a number, a series id, a citation, a date or a hash. `unknown` is allowed; a guess is not.
- Do not return JSON, a dashboard card, a zip, a spreadsheet, a second file, or this prompt pasted back.
- Do not add, rename, reorder or merge the deliverable sections.
- Do not report a directional edge from a sample you have not described.
- Do not use a value published after the cutoff, or a later revision, as what was known at the cutoff.
- Do not treat a local export, a passing replay test or a workflow run as evidence that anything is deployed, timely or profitable.
- Do not assume access to data this prompt does not name; if a test needs it, say what it is and where it would come from.

If a question can only be answered by breaking one of these, say so in the file rather than breaking it.

## What happens next

The adjudication becomes the record for this chain. It is the input to the asset synthesis chain, which reconciles every factor chain into one candidate model and one validation plan. Nothing is fitted or deployed at this step, and a treatment named here stays unvalidated until that plan runs and is itself reviewed.
