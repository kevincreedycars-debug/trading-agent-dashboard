# Central decisions

## 2026-09-20: coordinator and workers

- This canonical project owns overall architecture, priorities, integration,
  cross-project decisions and durable memory. Workers use separate worktrees.
- Shared immutable submission/reply files replace copying chat history. The
  coordinator reviews on request; no background runner has been configured.
- All five registered workers have bounded assignments. Existing asset workers
  must reconcile current state before more implementation is assigned. Their
  worktree HEADs are observed facts, not proof of current deployment or completion.
- Central review can accept, request changes, acknowledge or mark blocked. Accepted,
  integrated and deployed are distinct states. Production actions require the
  applicable user authorization; a worker submission does not supply it.

## Gold research facts and dependencies

Coverage milestone b8193ba is accepted in 0b0e92d. Twenty-eight variables are
declared, sixteen have a local source; availability is not measured association.
The accepted audit reports zero contiguous 24-hour windows in either cohort.
Immediate/event windows need appropriate resolution; five-trading-day horizons
need declared session rules. Hourly source duplicates were losslessly deduplicated.
See the complete evidence in `docs/DEEPSEEK_GOLD_RESEARCH_PROGRESS.md`.

Next proposal must address XAU/USD session/calendar and DST/holiday provenance,
hourly gap classification, anchor alignment, trailing five-session return and
volatility estimators, missing-context handling and a bounded first report.
The coordinator reviews the proposal before measurement implementation proceeds.
Source coverage, endpoint availability and contiguous tradable paths must remain
distinct. No gap filling or timestamp-policy change may silently manufacture evidence.

Order remains individual direction AND return magnitude -> prior-context
conditioning -> systematic combinations with all attempts and year stability ->
frozen formula and untouched qualification. Descriptive reaction is not causation
or reliable predictive influence. Programs perform bulk processing; AI writes,
debugs and interprets compact reports. Layer 1 agents remain independent and
backtesting downstream-only.

Known separate defect: accepted coverage checkpoint reports 356/360 full tests;
failures are confined to pre-existing secret-scanner console-width truncation.
This historical result is not a test result for new changes.
