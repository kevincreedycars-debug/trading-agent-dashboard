# Messages to paste into agent windows

These messages start the assignments; no agent has been started by creating these files.
Use the correct worker window. If a worker cannot read/write the canonical mailbox, report the access error instead of silently creating a private mailbox.

## gold-research

```text
Check your inbox for the coordinator's reply, then read your current assignment from the canonical project:
node D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/scripts/coordination.js check --worker gold-research
D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/docs/orchestration/assignments/gold-research.md
Your current assignment is gold-coverage-006. The revision-3 acceptance reply needs no reply; do not re-request the earlier Phase 1 approval, which this assignment supersedes.
Use D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/.local/worktrees/gold-research on branch workers/gold-research-policy-20260920, starting HEAD ffa380c. Implement the three prior Gold return variables, integrate them into the individual-variable reporter, add the boundary regressions and deliver the remaining-coverage and qualification plan exactly as specified there.
Preserve the accepted 005 artifacts and leave canonical originals, other workers and production untouched. Run the focused suites and npm test (local suite only), disclose exact failures, then submit a new immutable report:
node D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/scripts/coordination.js submit --file <absolute-path-to-your-submission.json>
Report actual activity at start and checkpoints, pause after submitting, and report the returned submission path. Stop for coordinator review.
```

## Coordinator prompt

```text
Check submissions. Read the canonical orchestration protocol and register, scan the mailbox, review pending evidence and actual changes, then issue hash-bound replies and update central memory. Do not assume reported work is accepted, merged or deployed.
```

## Worker follow-up prompt

```text
Check your central mailbox replies using your worker ID. Read the reply and current assignment from the canonical project. Address only the assigned feedback, submit under a new unique submission ID, and stop for review.
```
