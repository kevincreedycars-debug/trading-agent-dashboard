# Messages to paste into agent windows

These messages start the assignments; no agent has been started by creating these files.
Use the correct worker window. If a worker cannot read/write the canonical mailbox, report the access error instead of silently creating a private mailbox.

## Coordinator prompt

```text
Check submissions. Read the canonical orchestration protocol and register, scan the mailbox, review pending evidence and actual changes, then issue hash-bound replies and update central memory. Do not assume reported work is accepted, merged or deployed.
```

## Worker follow-up prompt

```text
Check your central mailbox replies using your worker ID. Read the reply and current assignment from the canonical project. Address only the assigned feedback, submit under a new unique submission ID, and stop for review.
```
