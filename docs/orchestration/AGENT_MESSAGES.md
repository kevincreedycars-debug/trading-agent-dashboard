Use the correct worker window. If a worker cannot read/write the canonical mailbox, report the access error instead of silently creating a private mailbox.

## gold-research

```text
Check your inbox for the coordinator's reply, then read your current assignment from the canonical project:
node D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/scripts/coordination.js check --worker gold-research
D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/docs/orchestration/assignments/gold-research.md
Your current assignment is `gold-coverage-025`, published 2026-09-25 under explicit user authority. The 28-factor exploratory circuit is closed: `gold-coverage-024` revision 2 was accepted (review docs/orchestration/reviews/20260925-gold-coverage-024-r2.md) with the repaired adapter, the 4956-candidate run (ledger f02a88cb), the analysis and the six focused tests all verified.
One deliverable, documentation only: write `docs/GOLD_BACKTEST_VERDICT_20260925.md`, one page (roughly 500-700 words) of plain English stating what the backtest does and does not establish, in this order - (1) what was asked and what was run (28 measured variables; the declared cell daily_snapshot_anchors / h24_post_event / all_computed / operator and / context prior_5session_return_sign; 4956 candidates declared before anything was evaluated, declaration commit 5fe48767, registry c19315e6, candidate list db96c728; run gold-combination-run-024-20260926-rev3 exit 0, ledger f02a88cb; 965 anchors with 964 computed outcomes; 4,782,540 attempts over 441,781 matched anchors; 441,319 observations; denominators 350,283 + 91,036 + 0 = 441,319); (2) what the numbers say in plain terms (2745 reportable at min_n 20, 704 below it, 1507 matched nothing, 0 unavailable, candidate-n median 74 with a third at zero, 4673 candidates with at least one unavailable anchor, 462 matched outcomes not computed - so the archive can describe this space but cannot support choosing from it); (3) what cannot be concluded and why (no accuracy, prediction, timing or edge conclusion; intervals spent; attempts dependent; session and calendar rules archive-derived; the five declared research definitions that are not live Layer 1 fields; anchor counts rather than anchor instants); (4) what a real verdict would need (the sealed prospective window with evaluation still sealed until 2027-03-25T15:00:00Z, or a new licensed dataset, each under a new bounded assignment - neither authorised here); (5) one short line naming where a reader can check each number, linking to docs/GOLD_COMBINATION_ANALYSIS_023.md and the durable reviews. Do not restate the 28 individual-variable blocks and keep docs/GOLD_VARIABLE_FINDINGS_AND_COVERAGE.md byte-identical.
Worktree: D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/.local/worktrees/gold-research on branch workers/gold-research-policy-20260920, starting HEAD cdd350af (024 revision 2 accepted). One writer only: never open a second session against this worktree.
Boundaries: no new run, candidate, measurement, source, credential, rule, threshold or formula; no ranking, winner, signal, formula, accuracy, win-rate, timing or edge claim; no prospective observation or holdout; no edit to any accepted artifact; no repository-level .gitattributes change; no production, warehouse, Layer 1, live workflow, dashboard or deployment action. Do not disturb the live v2 capture lane. The carried 022 item A anchor envelope for 2026-09-28T14:00:00Z|gold|entry remains due at or after 2026-09-28T16:00:00Z, and after that Gold stops.
Check every number against the accepted artifacts, then submit one immutable envelope with status ready_for_review:
node D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/scripts/coordination.js submit --file <absolute-path-to-your-submission.json>
Report actual activity at start and after the check, pause after submitting, and report the returned submission path. Stop for coordinator review.

## strategy-2

```text
This project is coordinated centrally by Codex at D:\trading-agent-dashboard-codex.
Read D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/docs/orchestration/README.md and D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/docs/orchestration/assignments/strategy-2.md from those absolute paths.
Your worker ID is strategy-2; assignment ID is strategy-advisory-2-001. Select DeepSeek in your existing agent extension for this window; this adds no API key, credential scope or provider configuration.
Use D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/.local/worktrees/strategy-2 on branch workers/strategy-advisory-2-20260924 (created 2026-09-24 from canonical 4884339).
Run this window on DeepSeek, exactly as adviser 1 does: the existing Cline extension with DeepSeek selected, no new key, credential or provider configuration.
Your lane is the live path and the multi-asset rollout: Layer 1/Layer 2 honesty and observability, the four unreconciled asset workers, the multi-asset readiness/multi-process rollout, and mailbox/background-reviewer automation. Adviser 1 (strategy) keeps the gold research engine lane; do not duplicate it and never contradict it silently.
Write only docs/strategy-2/ in your worktree plus ignored scratch. Never edit the canonical folder, the register, assignments or another worker's files, and never submit secrets.
Deliver docs/strategy-2/STRATEGY_LIVE.md and docs/strategy-2/CONVERSATION_NOTES.md, submit materially revised recommendations through the shared mailbox with a unique submission ID:
node D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/scripts/coordination.js submit --file <absolute-path-to-your-submission.json>
Report real activity with monitor-state.js activity strategy-2 working|paused|blocked "task", then pause.
This window is the only Strategy window connected to the mailbox bridge; keep it connected and leave adviser 1 disconnected.
```

## Coordinator prompt

```text
Check submissions. Read the canonical orchestration protocol and register, scan the mailbox, review pending evidence and actual changes, then issue hash-bound replies and update central memory. Do not assume reported work is accepted, merged or deployed.
```

## backtester-spike

```text
This worktree is coordinated centrally by Codex at D:\trading-agent-dashboard-codex.
Read D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/docs/orchestration/README.md and D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/docs/orchestration/assignments/backtester-spike.md from those absolute paths.
Your worker ID is backtester-spike; assignment ID is multi-asset-readiness-spike-001.
Use D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/.local/worktrees/backtester-spike on branch spike/multi-asset-readiness-20260924, base 927f799.
Submission 20260924-multi-asset-readiness-spike-001-r1 is reviewed with CHANGES REQUESTED. Read the reply first:
node D:/trading-agent-dashboard-codex/scripts/coordination.js check --worker backtester-spike
Then do exactly two things: make the hash-bound inputs byte-stable (a .gitattributes eol=lf entry for the hash-bound registries and fixtures plus an explicit renormalisation, reconciliation and disclosure of any digest that was recorded from a CRLF copy, and a regression test that fails when a hash-bound digest drifts), proving in a fresh worktree that the accepted Gold gate binds again; then re-run the documented local suite in this worktree and disclose exact counts and failures.
Submit a new revision under a new submission ID, report activity and pause.
Preserve every accepted Gold artifact and every other worktree. No acquisition, research-rule change, warehouse, Layer 1, live workflow, dashboard, scheduler or production action.
```

## Worker follow-up prompt

```text
Check your central mailbox replies using your worker ID. Read the reply and current assignment from the canonical project. Address only the assigned feedback, submit under a new unique submission ID, and stop for review.
```
